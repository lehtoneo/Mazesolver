### Maze creation

#### Prim maze generation algorithm

Performance tests were made so that 300 of each size maze were created. The time column shows the average time it took to create 
certain size maze. 

Results: 

| Maze size (n x n)  | (E + V)          | Time (ms)
| -------------    |:-------------:| ------------|
| 100x100          | 29800         | 0.01           |
| 127x127          | 48122         | 0.47           |
| 200x200          | 119600        | 2.12         |
| 500x500          | 749000        | 26.55      |
| 625x625          | 1561250       | 48.25      |
| 1000x1000        | 2998000       | 175.41    |

The growth seems to be exponential over n, as expected.

| 1222x1222        | 5970692       | 57.87    |

![Backtracker](https://github.com/lehtoneo/Mazesolver/blob/master/documentation/pictures/Backtrackerperf.png)

The growth is exponential over n and linear over E + V, as expected.

### Maze solving
For each maze solved by the algorithms below, performance tests were made so that 300 of each size maze were created by prim's algorithm. The time column shows the average time it took to solve the maze. The starting point for the algorithms were always the top-left path cell in the maze, and the ending point was the most right path cell in the last row. 

"V" in the tables below, is the estimate of path cells in the maze, which is calculated like this: V = (n * n)/2.  

The time column shows the average time it took to solve the maze. 

The length column shows the average length of the path that the algorithm found.
