# Week 3

Hours spent: ~12

## What I did

- Changed the project definition a bit
- Createdl linkedist
- Wallfollower algorithm
- More unit tests
- Created ui, now one can see how wallfollower algorithm works.


## What I learned
- Linkedlist is pretty much useless in this project. It can be possibly used as a stack, but I need to create a list which has
O(1) time complexity when it comes to getting an item from the list.
- How to config codecov


## What I will do next week
- Implement shortest path algorith to find paths in the maze
- Implement another list data structure
- Start performance testing
- Continue documentation
