# Week 5

Hours spent: ~18

## What I did

- Mode javadoc
- Tremaux's algorithm
- Performance tests for all of the current algorithms
- Boosted Prim's performance a bit with dynamic programming
- A lot of documentation
- Made it possible to remove walls from the created maze

## What I learned
- How Tremaux's algorithm works

## What I will do next week
- Implement a new maze creation algorithm
- Do some space complexity analysis
